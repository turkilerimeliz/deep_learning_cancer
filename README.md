# üß† Histopathological Image Classification for Lung and Colon Cancer Using Deep Learning

This project applies deep learning to classify histopathological images of lung and colon cancer into five distinct tissue categories. Using the LC25000 dataset, convolutional neural networks are developed and evaluated to support the early and automated diagnosis of cancer subtypes through medical image analysis.

## ü©∏ Background

Accurate and early diagnosis of lung and colon cancers is critical for treatment success. Manual inspection of histopathological slides, while effective, is time-consuming and prone to human error. Deep learning, particularly CNNs, offers the ability to automate this process with high accuracy. This project focuses on classifying histopathological images into five classes using both custom-built CNNs and transfer learning techniques.

## üéØ Objectives

- Perform multi-class classification on histopathological images from lung and colon tissue.
- Compare performance of three models:
  - Baseline CNN
  - Enhanced CNN with RandomSearch Tuning (10 trials)
  - Transfer Learning with VGG16
- Analyze model sensitivity across different cancer types.
